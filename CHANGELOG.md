# RSMPI Release Notes

## `main` branch

**MSRV:** 1.63

## 0.6.0 (2022-08-05)

**MSRV:** 1.54.0

### Notes

In order to use the `user-operations` optional feature (enabled by default), you may want to check
that  you are using at least `libffi-sys` version 1.1.0. This can be done by running `cargo
update`, but for most users this will likely be unnecessary.
